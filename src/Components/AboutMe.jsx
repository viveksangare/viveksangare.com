          Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ My love for technology started in school, and
          learning HTML, CSS in college (shoutout to the Marquee tag!) amazed
          me. I began as an <b>SEO Specialist</b> but soon realized my true
          passion was building web apps.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component="p" marginBottom="0.8rem">
          Now, I specialize in modern web technologies like React.js, Node.js,
          and JavaScript, blending my SEO background with web development to
          create impactful projects. Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools and
          sharpening my skills, including diving deeper into backend
          technologies like <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express</b>, and <b>MongoDB</b>.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component="p" marginBottom="0.8rem">
          Iâ€™ve also started learning <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> to
          achieve new heights and build smarter, more efficient solutions. When
          Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me experimenting with ideas or enjoying a
          good cup of coffee. â˜•
